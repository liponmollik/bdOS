A small piece of code (often written in Assembly) that runs first when the computer boots 
and is responsible for loading your kernel into memory and starting its execution. 
Tools like GRUB (GNU GRand Unified Bootloader) or Syslinux can help create bootable images, 
or you might write your own simple bootloader.

A modern bootloader for a contemporary operating system needs to perform several crucial functions to successfully hand over control to the kernel. Here's a breakdown of the key responsibilities:

Essential Functions:

    Hardware Initialization (Minimal):
        Basic CPU Setup: Setting the CPU to a known state (e.g., disabling interrupts, setting up basic registers).
        Memory Detection: Identifying the available RAM in the system. This information is crucial for the kernel's memory management.
        Early Console Initialization: Setting up a basic output mechanism (e.g., text mode VGA, serial port) to display boot messages and any errors. This is vital for debugging.

    Locating and Loading the Kernel:
        Accessing Boot Devices: Identifying and accessing the boot device (e.g., hard drive, SSD, USB drive, network).
        Filesystem Awareness (Basic): Understanding a simple filesystem (like FAT or a dedicated boot partition format) to locate the kernel image on the boot device. Modern bootloaders might even support more complex filesystems.
        Kernel Image Loading: Reading the kernel image from the boot device into a specific memory location. This often involves loading different segments (e.g., code, data) to their designated addresses.

    Preparing the Environment for the Kernel:
        Setting Up Memory: Establishing basic memory management structures (e.g., initial page tables in protected/long mode) so the kernel can start executing in a more sophisticated memory environment than the initial real mode.
        Passing Boot Information: Providing the kernel with essential information about the system and the boot process. This can include:
            Memory Map: Details about the available RAM and reserved memory regions.
            Boot Device Information: Identification of the device the kernel was loaded from.
            Command-Line Arguments: Options passed during the boot process by the user.
            Hardware Configuration (Basic): Potentially information about detected hardware.
        Setting Up Stack: Allocating and setting up an initial stack for the kernel to use.

    Transitioning to Kernel Execution:
        Setting the Execution Environment: Switching the CPU to the appropriate operating mode (e.g., protected mode on x86, long mode on x86-64). This involves setting up the Global Descriptor Table (GDT) or Local Descriptor Table (LDT).
        Jumping to the Kernel Entry Point: Transferring control of the CPU to the kernel's designated starting address.

Desirable Modern Features:

    Multi-Boot Support: The ability to boot multiple operating systems from different partitions or devices. 
GRUB (GNU GRand Unified Bootloader) is a prime example.
    Boot Menus: Providing a user interface to select which OS or kernel to boot, potentially with different kernel parameters.
    
    Configuration: Allowing users to configure boot options (e.g., kernel parameters, boot devices) through configuration files.
    Networking (Optional, but increasingly common for advanced scenarios): The ability to boot from a network (PXE boot) or download kernel images over the network.

    Secure Boot Support: Verifying the digital signature of the bootloader and kernel to prevent the loading of unauthorized software during the boot process. 
    This relies on cryptographic keys stored in the system's firmware (UEFI).

    UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) Integration: Modern systems use UEFI instead of the traditional BIOS. A modern bootloader often needs to be a UEFI application. This involves adhering to the UEFI specification and utilizing UEFI services.

    Device Tree Support (for ARM and other architectures): Loading and parsing a device tree blob (DTB) that describes the hardware configuration to the kernel.

    Modular Design: Allowing for extensions and modules to be loaded by the bootloader to support different filesystems or features.
    Error Handling and Recovery: Providing informative error messages if the boot process fails and potentially offering recovery options.
    Graphical User Interface (GUI) (Optional): Some advanced bootloaders might offer a graphical boot menu.

In the context of your modern OS kernel development, your bootloader will be the crucial first piece of software that runs on your bare metal. It needs to perform the essential tasks of initializing the very basic hardware, finding and loading your kernel, setting up the initial environment, and then gracefully handing over control so your kernel can take over and build the rest of your modern operating system.

Starting with the essential functions and gradually adding desirable modern features as your kernel develops is a practical approach. Good luck with this challenging and rewarding part of your OS development!
